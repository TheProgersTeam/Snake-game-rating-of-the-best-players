# Snake game rating of the best players

## What is it?
This is a game in which the player controls a long, thin creature resembling a snake, which crawls along the plane, collecting food, avoiding collisions with its own tail and the edges of the playing field. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it gets longer, which gradually complicates the game. The player controls the direction of movement of the snake's head, and the snake's tail follows. The player cannot stop the movement of the snake. There is also a rating of the best players in the game, it is a table consisting of three columns "#", "Player's name", "Number of points earned" ðŸ¥³
