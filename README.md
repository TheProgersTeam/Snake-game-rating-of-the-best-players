# Snake-game-rating-of-the-best-players

About the game 👾

👉 The player controls a long, thin creature resembling a snake, which crawls along the plane, collecting food, avoiding collisions with its own tail and the edges of the playing field. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it gets longer, which gradually complicates the game. The player controls the direction of movement of the snake's head, and the snake's tail follows. The player cannot stop the movement of the snake. 🐍

👉 There is also a rating of the best players in the game, it is a table consisting of three columns "#", "Player's name", "Number of points earned"

👉 The following technologies were used to implement the project:

1. PyGame - for implementing user interface and programming game logic.
2. Django and DjangoRestFrameWork - to implement the server side of the project.
3. Library Requests - To communicate with a remote server by sending it GET and POST requests.
